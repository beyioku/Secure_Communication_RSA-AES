# Secure_Communication_RSA-AES
This repository implements a secure communication mechanism using RSA for key exchange and AES in CBC mode for encryption, coupled with HMAC for message integrity verification. The system demonstrates key generation, encryption, decryption, and message authentication using Python's cryptography library.
